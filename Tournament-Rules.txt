502.3. Like cards, other relevant information about the game state can be public, derived, private, or secret.
502.4. The additional relevant public information includes:
502.4.a. The current turn player, phase, step, state of the turn, and who has priority and focus.
502.4.b. Rune Pools and the number and quantity of resources in them.
502.4.c. All players’ current scores.
502.4.d. A permanent’s current state, as distinct from its printed ones.
502.4.e. Spells and abilities on the Chain, their order, and play choices made for them.
502.4.f. Spells and abilities that resolved previously in the turn, and the sources of them are themselves public.
502.5. The additional relevant derived information includes:
502.5.a. Which public cards have been recycled.
502.5.b. The order of runes in a Rune Deck.
502.5.c. Consequences of actions that might happen in the future, such as a unit receiving a Might bonus from the Shield ability if a player attacks.
502.6. Players must announce changes to public information that result from their cards and effects.
502.7. Players must answer honestly any questions regarding public information.
502.8. Players must not represent public or derived information incorrectly.
502.9. Players must point out discrepancies between announced and recorded public information.
502.10. Judges are encouraged to help players determine public information, but not derived information.
503. Shortcuts
503.1. In competitions, players may take actions that skip parts of the technically precise play sequence without explicitly announcing that sequence.
503.2. The most common type of shortcut is skipping one or more parts of a turn, phase, or step to the mutual understanding of all involved players.
503.3. Players may request to use a new shortcut in a game but must be clear about the game state at the start and end of the shortcut.
503.4. Players may interrupt shortcuts by explaining where they want to intervene to take an action.
503.5. Players may interrupt their own shortcuts.
503.6. Players can’t use shortcuts they haven’t previously announced or modify existing shortcuts without announcement.
503.7. Players can’t interrupt a shortcut with the intent to do nothing.
503.8. When resolving spells or abilities, players can’t assume their opponents are using shortcuts without asking.
503.9. The following are common shortcuts for Riftbound competitions:
503.9.a. When a player channels runes or draws a card at the start of their turn, it is assumed that they have passed through the Beginning Phase.
503.9.b. When a player places a spell or ability on the chain, they are assumed to be passing priority unless they explicitly announce they intend to retain it.
503.9.c. When a player puts a spell or ability on the chain and announces choices for it that are normally made upon resolution, they must adhere to those choices unless their opponents react.
503.9.d. When a player asks about choices normally made upon resolution, they are assumed to be passing priority and allowing the spell or ability to resolve.
504. Sequencing
504.1. Complex series of game actions are sometimes shortcutted into out-of-order sequences, which are technically incorrect or imprecise, but arrive at the correct legal and understood game state.
504.1.a. Example: Drawing a card before channeling runes.
504.2. Players may ask their opponents to do these actions, or a subset of these actions, in the correct order so that they can react at the appropriate time.
504.3. Players can’t shortcut out-of-order in a way that gives them information prematurely that might affect decisions later in that sequence.
505. Loops
505.1. Some sequences of actions can be repeated and are shortcutted as a loop.
505.2. Players performing a loop must have each iteration of the loop be identical with no conditional actions.
505.3. To decide how to proceed with a loop, determine how many players are needed to maintain it (who must take actions or make decisions to sustain the loop):
505.3.a. No players
505.3.b. One player
505.3.c. Two or more players
505.4. For each maintaining player (if any), in turn order, that player chooses a number of iterations.
505.5. Each other player (if any), in turn order, may choose to agree to that number or choose a number of iterations after which they commit to taking action to break the loop or choose not to break the loop.
505.6. If no player chooses to break the loop and there were no maintaining players, the game ends in a draw.
505.7. Otherwise, the loop continues until the lowest number of iterations chosen, then that player either gains priority (if a maintaining player) or breaks the loop.
505.8. If a player intervenes to break a loop, they may choose to interrupt a partially completed iteration.
505.9. If a sequence of actions is non-deterministic, it may not be shortcut and iterations must be performed manually.
505.10. Some loops are maintained by decisions rather than actions. In these cases, apply 505.4-505.8 but with the player making a different decision rather than a different action.
505.11. Judges are the final arbiter of what constitutes a loop, or if choices are available to continue a loop when secret information is involved.
505.12. Players who try to opt-out of shortcutting or propose incorrect shortcutting to use up time are cheating. See 704.8 for more information about cheating.
506. Triggered Abilities
506.1. Players have a responsibility to remember their own triggered abilities.
506.1.a. Triggers caused by battlefields are controlled by the player triggering them, not the player who owns the battlefield.
506.2. Players are not required to notify other players of triggered abilities they don’t control, but they may if they wish.
506.2.a. At low OPL, it is not required to notify other players of their triggers, but it is encouraged for sportsmanship and learning.
506.3. Players must announce their triggers when they occur. If they do not, they are forgotten.
506.3.a. A trigger is considered forgotten once a new game action is taken without acknowledging the trigger.
506.3.b. Players can’t abuse this rule to intentionally forget their mandatory triggers. See 702.2 for more information about missed triggers as a penalty.
506.4. A triggered ability that was forgotten never goes on the chain.
506.5. A triggered ability that was forgotten is still considered to have triggered for the purpose of non-optional “once a turn” triggers.
507. Teams in Separate Matches
507.1. Players may communicate with teammates at all times unless explicitly prohibited by the format rules.
507.2. Players that acquire secret or private information about a match in which a teammate is playing can’t communicate with that teammate for the remainder of that match. See CR 127. Privacy for information types
508. Layout
508.1. In high OPL, players must arrange their cards according to the following rules, for clarity.
508.2. Runes must be closer to the player than nonrunes.
508.3. Nonrunes must be closer to the player’s opponent than the player’s runes.
508.4. Main Deck and trash must be together on either the left side or the right side of the board.
508.5. Rune Deck should be on the other side (right or left) of the board from the Main Deck.
508.6. Legend must be between nonrunes and Chosen Champion, and both legend and Chosen Champion must be together on either the left side or the right side of the board.
508.7. Each card or indicator that attaches to another card must be clearly associated with it physically.
508.8. Tokens must be represented by card objects that show all relevant information including ready state.
508.9. Bus must be represented by an object that unambiguously represents a bu in game terms.
508.10. Ready objects must be oriented facing the controller. Exhausted objects must be oriented at a 90 degree rotation to ready objects, either clockwise or counterclockwise, but all exhausted objects must be rotated consistently.
509. Player Rewind
509.1. In competitions, players are responsible for considering options before taking actions.
509.2. Once an action is communicated to an opponent, that action can’t generally be taken back.
509.3. A player can rewind and make a different decision about an action just taken if and only if they have not gained any new information since taking the action, and a judge allows it.
509.4. Judges who can’t be sure a player gained no information should not allow that player to rewind.
509.5. Teammates recommending a player rewind a decision before any other information is gained should not itself be considered new information.
600. Competition Formats
601. Constructed
601.1. Deck Construction
601.1.a. The rules for constructing a Riftbound deck are found in CR 101. Deck Construction, except where modified here below for the competition Constructed play format.

602. Limited
602.1. Sealed Deck
602.1.a. The rules for constructing a Riftbound deck are found in CR 101. Deck Construction, except where modified here below for the Sealed play format.
602.1.b. Sealed Deck is a limited format where players are provided with 6 unopened booster packs to construct their deck.
602.1.c. Main Decks in Sealed Deck are exactly 25 cards.
602.1.d. The domain identity of a limited deck is any three domains, or any domain plus the domains of its Champion Legend (if it has one).
602.1.d.1. A sealed deck may have any Champion Unit that is included in its domain identity as its Chosen Champion, even one that does not have a champion tag that matches its Champion Legend (if it has one).
602.1.d.2. A sealed deck may play any signature spells that are fully included in its domain identity, even if they do not include the corresponding champion.
602.1.d.2.a. Example: A sealed main deck with a domain identity of Fury/Body/Order could use signature spells that are Fury/Order or Body/Order, but not signature spells that are Fury/Mind or Body/Chaos.
602.1.e. A sealed deck is still legal if it has no Champion Legend or Chosen Champion.
602.1.e.1. A player may opt not to use a Champion Legend or a Chosen Champion in their sealed deck even if they opened one in their provided packs.
602.1.e.2. If a player's deck doesn't include both a Champion Legend and a Chosen Champion, they draw a card at the start of their first beginning phase each game. (If they have neither, they still only draw one card.)
602.1.f. In competitions where a sideboard is allowed, a limited deck’s sideboard is every card provided to the player as part of the competition that isn’t used in their deck construction, unless otherwise specified.
602.1.f.1. Players may change their domain identities while sideboarding as long as the resulting deck still meets c-d.
602.1.g. The normal limits on copies of named or signature cards do not apply.
602.1.h. Sealed decks must have at least three battlefields available, so if any are not included in the cards provided to the player as part of the competition, the player may use a blank battlefield represented by a facedown card.
602.1.h.1. A player may opt to use blank battlefields in place of battlefields they opened.
602.1.h.2. Players may select any battlefield from their sealed card pool during game start procedure.
602.1.h.2.a. In events where sealed deck registration is required, players must register a battlefield to be used in the first game of a match.
602.1.h.2.b. Players may only use a specific battlefield once per match, but may use the same named battlefield as many times as they have copies of it in their sealed card pool.
602.1.i. Players may use the six basic Runes from any source for play in a limited competition, even if they were not in the cards provided to the player as part of the competition.
602.1.i.1. Players may only include runes that match the domain identity of their main deck.
602.1.j. In some cases, competition officials may allow players to provide their own product, but in such cases player-brought products must be pooled and distributed amongst participants randomly.
602.1.k. Players may not use electronic devices to take notes or as a strategic aide during sealed deck building.
602.2. Sealed Pool Registration
602.2.a. In high OPL, the head judge must require registration of the sealed pool prior to deck construction.
602.2.b. Each player receives the unopened product at their seat.
602.2.c. Players on one side of the table (A) open their product, observed by players on the other side (B).
602.2.d. Once all unopened product has been opened and observed by B, those cards are placed next to B.
602.2.e. Repeat c but with B opening and A observing.
602.2.f. Each player now sorts and registers the contents of the pool placed next to them.
602.2.g. After registration is complete, each player returns the pool and registration sheet to the other side.
602.2.h. Each player verifies that their own pool has been registered correctly.
602.2.i. Deck construction begins.
602.2.j. It’s recommended that players be given 20 minutes for deck registration and 30 minutes for deck construction. Deck construction can be increased to 45 minutes for prerelease or release events where players are experiencing the cards for the first time.
602.2.k. The deck constructed is registered on the same sheet.
602.3. Preconstructed Decks in Limited Competitions
602.3.a. Some competitions or portions of competitions provide preconstructed decks for players to use. These are considered limited decks.
602.3.b. Players must use exactly the decks provided, except as modified by any addenda to the competition.
602.3.b.1. This may override the limited deck construction rules above.
602.4. Card Legality
602.4.a. A card may only be included in a limited deck if it is provided to the player as part of the competition.
602.4.b. Even if a card is banned in constructed, it is legal to use in a limited deck as long as it is not also banned in that limited format.
602.5. Continuous Construction
602.5.a. In limited formats at low OPL, players may freely change the composition of their deck and sideboard between matches.
602.5.b. In high OPL, this is not allowed and must be communicated as such by the head judge.
602.6. Abnormal Product
602.6.a. There is no guarantee that the composition or distribution of any specific sealed product is correct.
602.6.b. If a player notices a discrepancy between expected rarity or frequency of cards in a pack and what is opened, they must notify a judge.
602.6.c. The head judge may, at their discretion, replace atypical product in these cases.
603. 2v2
603.1. A 2v2 team consists of 2 players who enter a competition together and register together as a team to play congruently in a single match as described in the Core Rules.
603.2. Each player must provide their individual registration information to enter the competition.
603.2.a. When registering, teams must specify an ordering for the players on their team for seating purposes by indicating an A player and a B player.
603.3. If a player drops from a competition, their entire team is dropped.
603.4. If a player is disqualified from a competition, their entire team is disqualified.
603.5. In some competitions, 2v2 teams may provide a team name to be displayed. Tournament officials may disallow a specific name for any reason.
603.6. A 2v2 competition can be either constructed or limited. In limited 2v2, the team shares a single product pool of 8 packs.
603.7. During matches, teammates sit next to each other in their registered AB order. The setup process for a game of Riftbound is defined in the Core Rules, with these additional exceptions for 2v2:
603.7.a. Turn order is as follows:
603.7.a.1. The first team’s A player.
603.7.a.2. The second team’s A player.
603.7.a.3. The first team’s B player.
603.7.a.4. The second team’s B player.
603.7.a.5. Return to the top of the order.
603.7.b. A random method is used to decide which team selects the starting player.
603.7.c. Once the appropriate step in the core rules process is reached, the team that earned the decision chooses where within the a.1-4 turn order play begins.
603.7.c.1. For games after the first game of a match, the losing team of the previous game gets to choose who plays first. If the previous game was a draw, the turn order from the previous game is maintained.
700. Enforcement and Penalties
701. General
701.1. Philosophy
701.1.a. Errors are assumed to be committed unintentionally. If the judge believes it was intentional, it is cheating. See 704.8 for more information about cheating.
701.1.a.1. Players attempting to abuse error remedies to receive advantages are cheating.
701.1.b. Judges are neutral arbiters and enforcers of policy and rules.
701.1.c. Judges should not stop errors from occurring. Instead they deal with errors that have occurred.
701.1.d. Judges should not intervene in games unless:
701.1.d.1. They believe a violation has occurred.
701.1.d.2. A player requested assistance.
701.1.d.3. A situation related to Unsporting Conduct is likely to escalate.
701.1.e. Judges should model fair play, sporting conduct, and diplomatic behavior.
701.1.f. Judges should not account for a player’s history or skill when determining whether errors occurred.
701.1.g. Judges may take into account a player’s history or skill when investigating.
701.1.h. Penalties are designed to educate players on mistakes and encourage them not to make them in the future.
701.1.i. Penalties are also designed to deter other players from similar errors.
701.1.j. Penalties are issued and tracked to help judges understand intent over patterns of behavior.
701.1.k. Head judges and head judges ONLY may issue penalties outside of these guidelines.
701.1.l. Judges are human and they make mistakes.
701.1.m. If a judge recognizes their own mistakes, they should acknowledge them and correct them if possible.
701.1.n. If a competition official makes a mistake and it results in a penalty applied to a player, the head judge can downgrade the penalty.
701.1.o. If a player acts on information given in error by a competition official, the head judge can rewind the game to account for it, even if there were no other errors.
701.2. Definitions of Penalties
701.2.a. Warning: An indication that an error occurred that provides a record of the error.
701.2.a.1. Time extensions should be granted if the total time to rule and correct is more than 1 minute.
701.2.b. Game Loss: A game loss causes the erroring player and any of their teammates to concede the game. If this does not result in a winner, remaining players continue the game.
701.2.b.1. Game losses are applied immediately if the game is ongoing, or to the player’s next game in the competition if it is not.
701.2.b.2. If a player would receive multiple game losses at the same time, they only receive one.
701.2.b.3. If all players in a match receive a game loss simultaneously, the current game ends in a draw. All game losses are recorded but do not affect the match score.
701.2.c. Match Loss: A severe penalty that’s issued when the entire match has been compromised by the error.
701.2.c.1. Match losses are applied to the current match, or to the player’s next match in the competition if their previous match has ended.
701.2.d. Disqualification: A penalty issued for errors that damage the integrity of the competition or for severe misconduct.
701.2.d.1. Disqualification causes that player to lose the current match and be dropped from the competition.
701.2.d.2. If a player has already physically received prizes from the competition, they keep them, but they will not receive any other prizes after disqualification, even if their placement in the event would otherwise entitle them to prizes.
701.2.d.3. When a player is disqualified, they are removed from the competition and from standings.
701.2.d.4. Any attendee of a competition can be issued a disqualification, not just players. Being barred from the tournament venue may apply to disqualification at the head judge’s discretion.
701.2.d.5. This penalty can be issued by the head judge even without conclusive proof if the head judge determines the integrity of the competition has been compromised.
701.3. Applying Penalties
701.3.a. Penalties of Game Loss of higher (b-d) should be reported to the head judge.
701.3.b. Judges should explain the error, the procedure to fix it, and the penalties for involved players.
701.3.c. Some errors include remedies beyond the scope of the base penalty, to protect competition officials from accusations of bias.
701.3.d. If a single error leads to multiple related penalties, judges should issue only the one with the most severe penalty.
701.4. Shuffling
701.4.a. Some remedies require shuffling the randomized portion of the deck.
701.4.b. Many cards recycle cards to the bottom of a deck. The judge should do what they can using information available from the game state and from the players to determine which portion of the deck is knowable by one or more players, and separate those before shuffling that deck.
701.4.c. Once the deck has been shuffled, any cards set aside in this way should be returned to their proper locations in the deck.
701.4.d. Shuffles performed by a judge in this way are not considered shuffles in game terms.
701.5. Rewinding
701.5.a. Some remedies allow rewinding the game state in extreme circumstances, where leaving the game in its current state is substantially worse than rewinding.
701.5.b. Some rewinds are simple; this means rewinding only the last action completed or one currently in progress.
701.5.b.1. Any judge may perform a simple rewind where they believe no information has been gained by the players.
701.5.c. For rewinds more complicated than a simple rewind, only the head judge or designated appeals judges (at high OPL) may authorize rewinding in this way.
701.5.d. To rewind:
701.5.d.1. Each individual action since the time of the error is reversed, starting with the most recent one.
701.5.d.2. Every action must be reversed in the correct sequence.
701.5.d.3. If the identity of a card involved in a rewind is non-public (e.g. a drawn card), a random card is chosen from possible candidates.
701.5.d.4. If a player learned the identity of a card in a deck, but did not draw or channel it, it should be shuffled into the random part of the deck.
701.6. Investigations
701.6.a. Any penalty that results in disqualification automatically starts an investigation into that player and patterns of behavior that might impact their eligibility in future competitions.
701.6.b. Investigations may also occur at a judge's discretion following the application of a penalty if cheating is suspected. See 704.8 for more information about cheating.
701.6.c. The result of an investigation can be suspension of the player from Riftbound competitions.
701.6.d. Suspended players may not enter Riftbound events. If a suspended player is found to have registered for an event, the organizer reserves the right to issue a disqualification at any time.
702. Game Play Errors
702.1. Overview
702.1.a. A game play error is caused by incorrect and inaccurate play of the game that violates the Core Rules.
702.1.b. Except for 702.16, if a player commits the same category of game play error [Warning] 3 or more times in the same day of a competition, the penalty is upgraded to [Game Loss].
702.1.c. At low OPL, penalties should generally be less harsh and rewinds may be applied even if the erroring player gains an information advantage.
702.1.c.1. Penalties that require an opponent of the erroring player to make a choice can be made at random or by a judge if they can’t be avoided by a rewind.
702.2. Missed Trigger [No Penalty]: A player controls a triggered ability and doesn’t demonstrate awareness of the trigger before the first time it would affect the game in a visible fashion.
702.2.a. See 506 for definition of triggered abilities.
702.2.b. After the initial point at which a triggered ability is missed, any further errors related to that trigger are considered a General Error instead. See 702.15 for more information about General Errors.
702.2.c. Players may not cause triggered abilities controlled by an opponent to be missed by taking game actions or otherwise prematurely advancing the game, including through otherwise acceptable shortcuts.
702.2.d. A triggered ability is considered to have triggered even if it was subsequently missed. Effects that count or restrict the number of times that ability can trigger will count the missed one.
702.2.e. If missing the trigger was advantageous for the controller, and they own the card source of the trigger, this penalty is a [Warning] instead.
702.2.f. Remedies:
702.2.f.1. If a trigger is missed in a previous turn, instruct the players to continue playing.
702.2.f.2. Otherwise, the next opponent in turn order of the player who missed the trigger chooses whether to resolve the trigger immediately or miss it altogether.
702.3. Forgetting to Score a Point [No Penalty]: A player is entitled to a point from conquering or holding a battlefield but fails to track it.
702.3.a. This does not apply to points that would be scored from card triggers such as Ahri, Alluring.
702.3.b. Remedies:
702.3.b.1. If the correct score can be determined and no more than a full round cycle has passed, increment the appropriate player’s score to that total.
702.3.b.2. Otherwise, instruct the players to continue playing.
702.4. Forgetting to Draw Cards [No Penalty]: A player is obligated to draw a card, either as part of their draw phase or instruction from a card, but fails to do so.
702.4.a. Remedies:
702.4.a.1. If the missed draws can be determined and no more than a full round cycle has passed, the appropriate player draws the missing cards.
702.4.a.2. Otherwise, instruct the players to continue playing.
702.4.b. If forgetting to draw was advantageous to the erroring player (example: the player is near burning out), this penalty is a [Warning] instead.
702.5. Looking at Extra Cards [Warning]: A player takes an action that enables them to see the faces of cards they are not entitled to see.
702.5.a. Players are not entitled to see cards that are private (to another player) or secret.
702.5.b. Cards in a deck are considered to be in that deck unless and until they touch cards in another private or secret group. If that happens, the error is instead a Secret Card Error.
702.5.c. Remedies:
702.5.c.1. If the cards remain in a single deck, shuffle the deck appropriately to remove the information advantage.
702.6. Channeling Too Many Runes [Warning]: A player channels a number of runes greater than they are entitled to under the Core Rules as the result of a limited action.
702.6.a. Errors of this sort are generally public, and all players are expected to be mindful of game state.
702.6.b. Remedies:
702.6.b.1. If the additional runes have been used to pay for actions, rewind if possible. If rewinding is not possible, this is a General Error instead. See 702.15 for more information about General Errors.
702.6.b.2. If the additional runes are caught and no more than a full round cycle has passed, shuffle them appropriately into the rune deck.
702.6.b.2.a. If the specific runes can’t be identified, shuffle random runes instead.
702.6.b.3. Otherwise, instruct the players to continue playing.
702.7. Channeling Too Few Runes [No Penalty]: A player channels a number of runes less than what they are entitled to under the Core Rules as the result of a limited action.
702.7.a. Errors of this sort are generally public, and all players are expected to be mindful of game state.
702.7.b. Remedies:
02.7.b.1. If no more than a full round cycle has passed, allow the player to channel the appropriate number of runes.
702.7.b.2. Otherwise, instruct the players to continue playing.
702.7.c. If forgetting to channel runes was advantageous to the erroring player, this penalty is a [Warning] instead.
702.8. Overpayment for Cost [No Penalty]: A player pays a cost overpaying its power or energy cost.
702.8.a. Errors of this sort are generally public, and all players are expected to be mindful of game state.
702.8.b. Remedies:
702.8.b.1. If a cost is overpaid and it is still the turn where the cost was paid, the overpaying player is considered to have the extra resources floating in their resource pool.
702.8.b.1.a. If overpaying a cost was advantageous to the erroring player, this penalty is a [Warning] instead.
702.8.b.1.b. If overpaying a cost caused a result that would not otherwise have happened, it is a General Error. See 702.15 for more information about General Errors.
702.9. Mispayment for Cost [Warning]: A player pays a cost underpaying its power or energy cost, or uses the incorrect domain to pay a power cost.
702.9.a. Errors of this sort are generally public, and all players are expected to be mindful of game state.
702.9.b. Remedies:
702.9.b.1. Perform a simple rewind if possible, to the moment before the card was played.
702.9.b.2. If a simple rewind is not possible, correct the cost paid if possible, by exhausting, or recycling runes as needed.
702.9.b.2.a. If runes were incorrectly recycled as part of the cost, rewind if possible.
702.9.b.3. If rewinding is not possible, instruct the players to continue playing.
702.10. Looking at Secret Information [Warning]: A player looks at information that is not available to any player. See CR 127. Privacy for information types.
702.10.a. Players should not be penalized via a remedy for errors their opponents make. Example: If one of your opponents inappropriately flips over the top card of their deck, you do not receive a penalty if you see it.
702.10.b. Remedies:
702.10.b.1. If possible, take involved cards in the now-known secret information and re-randomize them with the original randomized source of appropriate cards to remove the information advantage.
702.10.b.2. If this is not possible, reveal the information to all players to remove the information advantage and instruct the players to continue playing.
702.11. Looking at Opponent Private Information [Warning]: A player accidentally looks at information that is private to their opponent. See CR 127. Privacy for information types.
702.11.a. Players should not be penalized via a remedy for errors their opponents make. Example: If one of your opponents inappropriately drops a card from their hand on the table, you do not receive a penalty if you see it.
702.11.b. Remedies:
702.11.b.1. The opponent whose private information it is may decide whether to take involved cards in the now-known private information and re-randomize them with the original randomized source of appropriate cards.
702.11.b.2. If they decide not to, instruct the players to proceed.
702.12. Drawing Extra Cards [Warning]: A player draws more cards than they are entitled to under the Core Rules as the result of a limited action.
702.12.a. Drawing extra cards is also looking at extra cards, but only this error should be recorded.
702.12.b. Remedies:
702.12.b.1. If the error is caught before the extra cards drawn are added to a private set, shuffle them into the main deck appropriately to remove the information advantage.
702.12.b.2. If the error is caught after the cards drawn are added to a private set and it is within the round cycle, the next opponent in turn order of the erroring player looks at that player’s hand and chooses the appropriate number of cards to shufle into the main deck appropriately.
702.12.b.3. If at a later stage in the game it is determined a player has more cards in hand than they should, the remedy should be applied at this time.
702.13. Nonpublic Card Error [Warning]: A player interacts with a nonpublic card in a manner other than how they are entitled to under the Core Rules.
702.13.a. This includes hiding a card that does not have the Hidden keyword.
702.13.b. Upgrades to [Game Loss] if a player hides a card that doesn’t have the Hidden keyword and doesn’t correct it before it has an impact on an opponent’s action.
702.14. Mulligan Procedure Error [Warning]: A player performs the mulligan procedure incorrectly.
702.14.a. Remedies:
702.14.a.1. If a player recycled and replaced more than 2 cards during their mulligan, the next opponent in turn order of the erroring player looks at that player’s hand and may choose cards up to the number of extra cards mulliganed to have that player recycle and replace.
702.14.a.1.a. Example: If a player accidentally mulliganed 3 cards, the next opponent in turn order would look at that player's hand and may choose up to one card to have that player recycle and replace.
702.14.a.2. If this error is caught after gameplay has begun, instruct the players to proceed.
702.15. General Error [Warning]: Any other violation of the Rules of Riftbound.
702.15.a. This is a catch-all for any other game play error.
702.15.b. Errors of this sort are generally public, and all players are expected to be mindful of game state.
702.15.c. Remedies:
702.15.c.1. Rewind if possible.
702.15.c.2. Otherwise, instruct the players to continue playing.
702.16. Failure to Maintain Game State [Warning]: A player does not call out another player’s failure to maintain the proper game state, including missed scoring from hold and conquer.
702.16.a. Generally this error occurs when a player’s opponent commits a game play error and the player doesn’t call a judge immediately.
702.16.b. Unlike other Game Play Errors, this error is primarily for tracking and never upgrades unless specifically instructed by the head judge.
703. Tournament Errors
703.1. Overview
703.1.a. A tournament error is caused by actions in or around a tournament match that violate tournament procedure expectations.
703.1.b. If a player commits the same category of tournament error [Warning] 3 or more times in the same day of a competition, the penalty is upgraded to [Game Loss].
703.1.c. At low OPL, penalties should generally be less harsh and rewinds may be applied even if the erroring player gains an information advantage.
703.1.c.1. Penalties that require an opponent of the erroring player to make a choice can be made at random or by a judge if they can’t be avoided by a rewind.
703.2. Slow Play [Warning]: A player is performing their start of game procedure or is playing mid-game at an unreasonably slow pace.
703.2.a. Players must take their turns in a timely manner, appropriate to a judge according to the state of the game at the time, and adhere to time limits specified for the tournament.
703.2.b. Players may ask a judge to watch their game for slow play.
703.2.c. Intentionally stalling to gain an advantage is cheating. See 704.8 for more information about cheating.
703.3. Decklist Error [Game Loss]: A player submits a decklist for registration that contains illegal elements.

703.4.b. Remedies:
703.4.b.1. If the error is caught by any player before opening hands have been drawn, restore the deck to its correct state if possible and instruct players to proceed.
703.4.b.2. If the error is caught by the erroring player after opening hands have been drawn and it is easily possible, restore the deck to its correct state and instruct players to proceed. For example:
703.4.b.2.a. In game one of a match a player realizes they forgot to restore their deck to a pre-sideboard state.
703.4.b.2.a.1. A judge can restore their deck to the appropriate state by returning cards to the main deck and sideboard as needed.
703.4.b.2.a.1.a. If sideboard cards are in the player's hand, they are replaced randomly by main deck cards that were incorrectly in the sideboard.
703.4.b.2.a.2. Shuffle the randomized portion of the main deck once this process is complete.
703.4.b.3. If the error is caught by a player other than the erroring player after opening hands have been drawn, the penalty is upgraded to [Game Loss].
703.4.b.3.a. Players may request a judge check an opponent’s deck for legality. (Example: A player believes an opponent has a sideboard card in the first game.)
703.4.b.4. If restoring the deck to its correct state is not easily possible, the penalty is upgraded to [Game Loss].

703.6.c. The Head Judge has the authority to determine if a card in a player’s deck is marked.
703.6.d. Remedies:
703.6.d.1. Judges may request that a player remove their current sleeves or replace any of the deck’s current sleeves or cards immediately, or before the next round.
703.6.d.2. If the cards required to correct the deck cannot be acquired in a timely manner, the head judge can issue a proxy.
703.7. Insufficient Randomization [Warning]: A player did not sufficiently randomize their deck when required to.
703.7.a. If a player believes an opponent has not sufficiently randomized their Main Deck or Rune Deck before presenting them, they may call a judge.
703.7.b. Pile shuffling is not a sufficient randomization method and should only be used as a counting method.

703.8.c. If the player arrives after 10 minutes of the round start, the penalty is a [Match Loss].
703.8.d. If a player never arrives for their match, the penalty is a [Match Loss] and the player is dropped from the tournament unless they report to a judge before the next match begins.

703.9. Outside Assistance: A player receives advice or strategic assistance from an individual outside of the match.
703.9.a. If the player receiving the advice actively refuses the advice by calling a judge, they receive a [Warning]. Otherwise, that player receives a [Match Loss]. This penalty does not apply if the head judge deems the advice was delivered maliciously.
703.9.b. If the player receiving the advice solicited the advice, it is cheating. See 704.8 for more information about cheating.
703.9.c. Spectators providing advice may be barred from the tournament venue if the advice was given maliciously or knowingly.
703.9.d. It is not outside assistance to receive strategic advice from a teammate in the 2v2 format or in other team formats when specified.
